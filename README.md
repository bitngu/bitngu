Hello, my name is Bi Nguyen and I’m interested in Software Development and Predictive Modeling. I’m currently trying to improve my knowledge
in Machine Learning and Operating Systems. As of now, I'm working on my portfolio website ([bitngu.com](https://www.bitngu.com/)) to showcase my skills 
and past projects while looking for a Fall internship and full-time position as a Software Engineer.
